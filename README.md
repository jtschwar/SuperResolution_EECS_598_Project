# SuperResolution_EECS_598_Project
Implementations of deep learning models applied on super-resolution for Deep Learning for Computer Vision Project (EECS 598). Single image super-resolution aims to recover a high-resolution image from a single low resolution image, is a classical problem in computer vision.

This project contains PyTorch implementations of different architectures for single image super-resolution. The implemented networks include: 

- The super resolution convolutional neural network described in [Image Super-Resolution Using Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092) (C. Dong, et. al. 2014)

- The Fast-super resolution convolutional neural network described in [Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00367)
